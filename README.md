## About

Most traction drive applications lack accurate temperature
monitoring capabilities, requiring expensive large motor designs to ensure safe operation. Traditional thermal modelling
necessitates knowledge of model parameter selection, which
is influenced by factors such as motor geometry, cooling
dynamics, and hot spot characterization. More- over, their
major advantage over data-driven techniques, which is physical
interpret ability, tends to diminish as soon as their degrees
of freedom are reduced in order to satisfy the real-time
need. In this article we have used KNN model, Polynomial
Regression and Linear Regression model to find the best
predictive analytic pipeline.
